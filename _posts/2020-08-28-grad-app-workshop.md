The research proposal guide with examples mentioned in the workshop, by Lia, is linked at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkKmrm47vUbAtMjdWnOX_mo5z1AsaseXbPBVsB7S82A/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkKmrm47vUbAtMjdWnOX_mo5z1AsaseXbPBVsB7S82A/edit?usp=sharing).  It will be edited and moved from Google docs to a post on this site later this weekend.

Also later this weekend, a Q & A will be compiled here of questions answered in the workshop text chat and on Discord.
