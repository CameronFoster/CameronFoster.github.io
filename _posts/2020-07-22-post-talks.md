Hello!  This is a guide to free recorded talks/papers/resources from recent conferences, workshops, and schools for which videos were recorded, from most to least recent.  It's certainly not an exhaustive list, but includes all the ones I can think of with online talks or lessons.  The quantum schools (aka bootcamps) here are accessible to students of the undergraduate level.  While the conference talks' intended audiences are researchers in the field, I think for undergrads, listening to the first few minutes of a talk can give quite a bit of insight.

**2020 Qiskit Global Summer School**
[[Website](https://qiskit.org/events/summer-school/)]
A free 2-week online summer school July 20-31 by IBM, introducing quantum computing preliminaries before focusing on superconducting devices and quantum chemistry applications.  It says no prerequisites are needed except knowing how to multiple two matrices and a bit of Python - you just have to be age 14 and up.  Should the summer school materials be made publicly available in the coming weeks, the link above will be updated).

**International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications**
[[Program](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spcom/2020/thematic_workshop.html)]
Talk recordings of the Current Trends in Quantum Information Processing workshop will be at the link above soon.

**STAQ Quantum Ideas Summer School**
[[Curriculum](https://staq.pratt.duke.edu/summer-school)]
An annual one-week summer school for undergrads, grad students, and industry participants at Duke University, which leads the Software-Tailored Architectures for Quantum Codesign (STAQ) research collaboration.  2019 lecture notes and 2020 (virtual) lecture notes, recorded lectures, and problem sets are online linked above, covering quantum info basics, quantum algorithms, ion traps, basics of superconducting transmon qubits, architectures, and quantum error control.

**Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation** (PLDI)
[[Program](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/program/program-pldi-2020) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp5mvxARtX5ncjy9p4X_Ajwd)]
An annual conference by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on programming languages (ACM SIGPLAN), online due to pandemic.  You can view the two recorded quantum programming language talks' abstracts and papers via the Program link above, and see the lightning talks (the tl;dr of the full talks) and the full talks at the YouTube playlist linked above.  There is also a 4-part, 7-hr tutorial on quantum computing accessible [here](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2020-tutorials/2/Programming-Quantum-Computers-A-Primer-with-IBM-Q-and-D-Wave-Exercises) by clicking Quantum tutorial live stream, then YouTube live stream.

**Quantum.Tech Digital Week**
[[Agenda](https://www.quantumtechdigital.co.uk/agenda/digital-week-day-1) and [On-demand talks](https://www.quantumtechdigital.co.uk/landing/qt-digital-week-on-demand)]
A week-long online event organized by Alpha Events focusing on the business side of quantum technologies.  You can see the talks for free online if you fill out some basic personal info.  They're starting a free monthly webinar series called [Quantum Thursdays](https://www.quantumtech-digitalday.com/).

**International Symposium on Computer Architecture** (ISCA)
[[Main Program](https://www.iscaconf.org/isca2020/program/) and [QRE2020 Schedule](http://www.quantumresource.org/)]
The top computer architecture conference, by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Architecture (ACM SIGARCH) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), 5% the usual cost to attend due to pandemic.  I was able to download the recorded talks (which require registration to view) in a hacky way but hesitate to upload them.  The ISCA papers are viewable at the Main Program link above - they recommend reading the paper before the talks anyway.  There is both a quantum session at ISCA, and Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE2020) workshop for which half the slides are viewable without registration.

**Quantum Computing Theory in Practice** (QCTIP) **2020**
[[Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1poD72BIZgDK1nJ3ao2_nbYRTJ-Yx1H3f?usp=sharing) and the [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194LDZQrx4GYFWUcQJyVEjeMaATIbbKPDT5oiRu2zmb8/edit?usp=sharing) in it]
A virtual conference hosted by quantum computing software company Riverlane based in Cambridge.  All but 2 talks are on YouTube; program, slides, and papers linked above.

**First International Workshop on Programming Languages for Quantum Computing** (PLanQC)
[[Talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6IbJx8MJ-_lkRU4G6BbXtl) and [website](https://popl20.sigplan.org/home/planqc-2020#event-overview)]
A workshop organized by researchers at the University of Maryland, co-hosted with the 47th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages ([POPL 2020](https://popl20.sigplan.org/)) in New Orleans.  All talks are on YouTube linked above.  Abstracts and some slides and links to papers are at the site linked above.

I'm still working on adding DAMOP 2020 to the above list, but I think all the talks require registration to view, which many people (including myself) had technical difficulties with.
