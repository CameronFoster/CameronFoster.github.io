You could say this project had three parts to its origin story:

- an undergraduate student-led seminar taught/ran by Lia Yeh at the University of California, Santa Barbara in Spring 2020, <a href="https://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/courses/2020/spring/full-stack-quantum-computation">Full-Stack Quantum Computation</a>
- a grant to build a community-driven open-source quantum education website from the <a href="https://unitary.fund">Unitary Fund</a>, a non-profit working to create a quantum technology ecosystem that benefits the most people
- a quantum education channel and online meet-up at the 2020 Qiskit Global Summer School Discord server

We have a Discord server open to all people interested in quantum universal education (PIQUE).  In other words, we are an international online group of people passionate about community-driven open-source, universal quantum education!  We give you the warmest welcome at our join link https://discord.gg/NDm9e9W
